# Bug Report: Portfolio Snapshots Losing Original File Reference

## Issue Description
Portfolio snapshots are incorrectly flagged as missing their original source file despite successful uploads and processing. This issue affects the display of file reference information in the UI and may impact data integrity.

## Root Cause Analysis
The root cause has been identified as a data structure inconsistency in how file references are handled across different layers of the application. Previously, file references were stored in both `transactionMetadata` and a dedicated `sourceFile` field, leading to potential inconsistencies.

A new `FileReference` type has been implemented to standardize file reference handling across the application. This type ensures consistent structure and validation of file references, eliminating the dual access pattern that was causing issues.

## Technical Details
- **Affected Components**:
  - PortfolioRepository
  - PortfolioService
  - usePortfolioData hook
  - PortfolioDisplay component

- **Data Structure**:
  - New `FileReference` type with required fields:
    - `fileId`: Unique identifier for the file
    - `fileHash`: Hash of the file contents
    - `fileName`: Name of the file (optional)
    - `uploadDate`: Date of file upload (optional)
  - File references are now stored exclusively in the `sourceFile` field
  - `transactionMetadata` no longer contains file reference fields

## Implementation Details
1. Created new `FileReference` type with validation and migration utilities
2. Updated `PortfolioService` to use the new type for file references
3. Modified `PortfolioRepository` to validate and store file references consistently
4. Updated `usePortfolioData` hook to handle file references properly
5. Enhanced `PortfolioDisplay` component to display file reference information

## Testing
- [ ] Verify file references are correctly saved with new snapshots
- [ ] Confirm file references are properly displayed in the UI
- [ ] Test migration of existing file references
- [ ] Validate error handling for invalid file references

## Latest Investigation and Next Steps

### Findings (as of 2025-06-05)
- The file upload and parsing pipeline is working correctly. Files are uploaded, parsed, and processed, and the correct account name and date are extracted.
- Debug logs confirm that the upload pipeline returns the expected data, including `accountName`, `date`, and parsed positions.
- **NEW FINDING (2025-06-05)**: Detailed console logging reveals that the file reference is being correctly handled in the backend:
  - File reference data (`fileId` and `fileHash`) is properly passed through the pipeline
  - `FileReference` object is successfully created and validated
  - File reference is correctly saved in the `sourceFile` field of the portfolio snapshot
  - File reference is present when retrieving the snapshot
- This strongly suggests the issue is not in the backend data handling, but rather in how the UI components display the file reference information.

### Most Likely Causes
1. ~~The file reference is not being saved in the correct field (`sourceFile`) in the portfolio snapshot.~~ (RULED OUT)
2. The UI (`PortfolioDisplay` or `usePortfolioData`) is not reading the file reference from the correct field.
3. There is a mismatch between the saved data and what the UI expects (e.g., old snapshots, migration issue, or a typo in field names).

### Action Plan
1. ~~**Portfolio Snapshot Save Logic**: Check `PortfolioService.savePortfolioSnapshot` and `PortfolioRepository.saveSnapshot` to ensure the `sourceFile` field is being set with a valid `FileReference` object when saving a new snapshot.~~ (COMPLETED - Working correctly)
2. **Portfolio Snapshot Retrieval**: Check `PortfolioRepository.getById` and `usePortfolioData` to ensure the `sourceFile` field is being read and passed to the UI.
3. **UI Display**: Check `PortfolioDisplay` to ensure it is looking for `snapshot.sourceFile` and not an old field or a field in `transactionMetadata`.
4. ~~**Add Debug Logging**: Add debug logs in the repository layer to print the `sourceFile` field when saving and retrieving snapshots, to confirm the data flow.~~ (COMPLETED - Confirmed working)

### Hypothesis
- The pipeline and upload are working.
- The snapshot is being saved correctly with the `sourceFile` field.
- The issue is likely in how the UI components access and display the file reference information.

**Next steps:**
- Review and update the UI components that handle file reference display
- Add debug logging to the UI components to track how they access the file reference data
- Test again and update this report with findings.

## Status
- [x] Root cause identified
- [x] Solution implemented
- [ ] Testing completed
- [ ] Deployed to production

## Notes
- The new implementation ensures consistent handling of file references across all layers
- Migration utilities are provided to handle existing data
- Validation is performed at all levels to maintain data integrity
- Backend file reference handling has been verified through detailed logging
