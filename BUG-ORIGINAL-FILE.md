# Bug Report: Original File Correlation Issue

## Description
When portfolio snapshots are uploaded, the system correctly stores and parses the data, but incorrectly reports missing original files in the File Manager. This indicates a correlation issue between the processed data and the stored raw files.

## Current Behavior
- Portfolio snapshots are successfully uploaded and parsed
- Data is correctly stored in the database
- File Manager incorrectly displays "Missing Original Files Detected" message
- Message appears even when original files are present
- Message suggests uploading files that are already stored

## Expected Behavior
- File Manager should correctly identify when original files are present
- No "Missing Original Files" message should appear when files are properly stored
- System should maintain correct correlation between processed data and raw files

## Impact
- Creates confusion for users
- May lead to unnecessary re-uploading of files
- Undermines confidence in the data integrity system
- Makes it harder to identify actual missing file cases

## Technical Details
- Issue appears to be in the correlation logic between processed portfolio data and stored raw files
- The system is successfully storing both the processed data and original files
- The verification/checking mechanism is incorrectly reporting missing files

## Related Components
- File Manager
- File storage system
- Portfolio snapshot processing
- Original file storage mechanism

## Priority
High - This affects the core data integrity feature of the system and user confidence in the application.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Upload two portfolio snapshot files
2. Verify that both files are processed and stored correctly
3. Check File Manager
4. Observe incorrect "Missing Original Files" message

## Notes
This bug was first documented in version 0.4.101 of the application.
