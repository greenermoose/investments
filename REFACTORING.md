# Utility Functions Refactoring Summary

## New File Structure (utils directory)

1. **formatters.js**
   - Currency and percentage formatting functions
   - Added generic `formatValue` helper
   - Clean, single responsibility

2. **dateUtils.js**
   - Date parsing from filenames
   - Date formatting
   - Date extraction from account info
   - Consolidated all date-related utilities

3. **securityUtils.js**
   - Symbol normalization
   - Symbol comparison
   - Account name extraction
   - Account total row detection
   - Security-specific utilities

4. **fileUtils.js**
   - CSV export functionality
   - Centralized file handling
   - Simplified download logic

5. **calculationUtils.js**
   - Portfolio statistics calculations
   - Asset allocation calculation
   - Lot calculations (average cost, unrealized gains)
   - All math operations centralized

6. **csvParser.js** (restructured)
   - Cleaner field type mapping
   - Separated parsing logic into smaller functions
   - Removed duplicate utilities now in other files

7. **portfolioAnalyzer.js**
   - Improved organization
   - Added imported utilities
   - Kept analysis-specific logic

8. **index.js**
   - Central barrel file for clean imports

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Eliminated Duplication
- Removed duplicate functions across files
- Consolidated formatting utilities
- Single source of truth for calculations

### 2. Improved Import Clarity  
- Components now import specific utilities needed
- No more random calculations scattered across files
- Clear dependencies

### 3. File Size Reduction
- PortfolioManager.jsx is significantly smaller
- Components focus on UI rendering
- Logic moved to appropriate utilities

### 4. Better Separation of Concerns
- Each file has a single, clear purpose
- Utilities are grouped by domain
- Easier to maintain and test

### 5. Enhanced Reusability
- More granular functions
- Generic formatValue helper
- Standardized calculations

## Updated Component Structure

Components now use clean imports:
```javascript
import { formatCurrency, formatPercent } from '../utils/formatters';
import { formatDate } from '../utils/dateUtils';
import { calculatePortfolioStats } from '../utils/calculationUtils';
```

## Next Steps

1. Extract custom hooks from PortfolioManager
2. Create context providers for state management
3. Further componentize UI elements
4. Add comprehensive tests for utilities
